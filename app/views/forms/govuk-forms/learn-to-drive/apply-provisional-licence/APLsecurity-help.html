        Ensuring your online transactions are safe and secure
    </h1>
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What we do about security</h2>
  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Secure connections and encryption</h3>
  <p>When you visit this website, all information that you send and receive is transferred through a Secure Socket Layer
    connection (SSL). SSL creates a secure link between your browser and our server. We use SSL with 128-bit encryption
    which is widely accepted as the industry standard.</p>
  <p>SSL encrypts your personal information before it leaves your computer and guarantees that: <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>it is not altered between your computer and our server</li>
      <li>unauthorised users cannot read it</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>You will always know when you are using a secure connection because a padlock icon is displayed on the status bar of
    your browser and the address will begin with 'https'. Depending on your browser setting, a pop-up window can appear to
    notify you that you will be entering a secured page.</p>
  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Session time-out</h3>
  <p>If you remain inactive for a period of time during a session, then our system will automatically time you out. This
    is to minimise the risk of someone else using your session on a shared computer. You should, however, also remember to
    close the browser at the end of your online session.</p>
  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Technology</h3>
  <p>We use many layers of security - for obvious reasons we cannot disclose all of them, but the following are typically
    used: <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>All our operating systems are immediately updated with the latest security patches</li>
      <li>Our anti-virus software is updated regularly</li>
      <li>Our systems have firewalls to prevent unauthorised intruders</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you can do about security</h2>
  <p>There are some simple things you can do to get the most protection for the least effort. By following these you will
    greatly increase your PC's protection, not just when you use our online services but when you use the internet
    generally.</p>
  <p>These are not all the measures you can take, but are an excellent start. They are equally applicable to business
    owners and to private individuals.</p>
  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Update your operating system &amp; browser on a regular basis</h3>
  <p>From time to time vulnerabilities are discovered in these programs. The publisher will then release a 'patch' or
    'security update' to correct this weakness. These weaknesses are regularly exploited by virus writers and hackers to
    gain unauthorised access to those PC's that have not been updated. To check for updates you should visit the
    publisher's website, typically in their Download section, or use your operating system's automatic update feature.</p>
  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Use and regularly update your anti-virus software</h3>
  <p>You may already be using anti-virus software but to be effective the software should make sure it has the latest
    virus definition files each time you connect to the internet. (If you are unsure how to configure this, you should
    refer to the software's Help function.)</p>
  <p>It is also possible to obtain free anti-virus protection. A search for 'free anti-virus' on a search engine will
    provide a list of the most popular products.</p>
  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Use a 'personal firewall'</h3>
  <p>A firewall is another small program that helps protect your computer and its contents from outsiders on the internet.
    When installed it stops unauthorised traffic to and from your PC. Enter 'personal firewall' on a search engine for
    information on products.</p>
  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Emails</h3>
  <p>Email is a great way to communicate, but unfortunately fraudsters also use the medium to target victims.</p>
  <p>We will <strong>never</strong> ask you to confirm your personal information by email.</p>
  <p>Don't open emails from unknown senders. If you are in doubt about the source of an email, for example if you don't
    recognise the sender, it's advisable to delete it. Emails are often used to spread viruses, or download software that
    will allow unauthorised access to your PC. It is advisable to never open unexpected attachments and to never follow
    links to internet sites you're not familiar with.</p>
  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Accessing our website</h3>
  <p>Only access our website using the links from the DVLA website or the Directgov motoring home page; any other links
    could take you to a phoney website that may look exactly like ours.</p>
  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Autocomplete</h3>
  <p>If you have 'autocomplete' set on your browser your computer will store and remember data you have entered in the
    past. You should turn autocomplete off to protect your data. You can also clear the history of data that has been
    saved in the past - please refer to your browser help for details on how to do this.</p>
