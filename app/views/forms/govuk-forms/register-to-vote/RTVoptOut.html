      <p>The electoral register lists the name and address of everyone who’s registered to vote.</p>

      <p>There are 2 versions of the electoral register - the full version and the ‘open register’ (‘edited register’ in Northern Ireland).</p>
      
      <p>You can opt out of the open register. This is the version of the register that’s available to anyone who wants to buy a copy.</p>
      
      <p>Opting out will not affect your right to vote.</p>
