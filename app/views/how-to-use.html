    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Using Zoom during the class</h2>
    <p>Classes will be on Zoom initially. You will receive a link before the meeting.</p>
    <p><a href="/help.html"><strong>Get help with Zoom</strong></a></p>
          
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Going back to forms menu</h2>      
    <p>You can go back to the homepage where you can find the forms menu at any time by clicking or tapping on the <strong>logo at the top left</strong>  or the "<strong>This is a training website</strong>" tag or by selecting <strong>Home</strong> in the footer.</p>
    <p>Note that <strong>the top left logo will be different on some forms </strong>but it will still take you back on the homepage.</p>
   
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Using a form</h2>
    <p>You can select a form from the menu on the Homepage. It will take you to an <strong>introduction page</strong>. We will tell you what is different from the real form and will inform you if the form is not finished yet.</p>
    <p>The form will be different from the real one. We have simplified it.</p>
    <p>On some pages, you will see a <strong>box with some explanations below the form</strong>. They are not part of the real form. They were added to give you a bit more information about how we have changed the form.</p>
    
    <div class="student-notes-box">
        <p>This is an example of explanation box</p>
    </div>

    <p>Please note that <strong>the real live form might have changed since we reproduced it here</strong>. A lot of these services are constantly improved.</p>
    <p>Please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> if you notice something is wrong.</p>
    
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Clear the data</h2>  
    <p>Anything you enter in the form is not sent anywhere but it will be 'memorised' during the session.</p>
    <p>You should clear the data when a different person is using the same device (phone or computer). To do this, follow the link '<strong>Clear the data</strong>' in the footer.</p>
    <p><strong>You might also want to clear the browser cache</strong> if you are not using your own device: some of the data you have entered during the session might still appear in the autocomplete functionality of your browser (Internet Explorer, Chrome, Safari for example).</p>
    <p>If you are not sure how to do this, you can <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clear-cache-2617980" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read this article explaining how to clear the cache of your browser</a></p>
